Two Men and the Elders

The Elders of this particular region of Rossem were not exactly what one might have expected.
They were not a mere extrapolation of the peasantry; older, more authoritative, less friendly.

Not at all.

The dignity that had marked them at first meeting had grown in impression till it had reached
the mark of being their predominant characteristic.

They sat about their oval table like so many grave and slow-moving thinkers. Most were a trifle
past their physical prime, though the few who possessed beards wore them short and neatly
arranged. Still, enough appeared younger than forty to make it quite obvious that "Elders" was
a term of respect rather than entirely a literal description of age.

The two from outer space were at the head of the table and in the solemn silence that
accompanied a rather frugal meal that seemed ceremonious rather than nourishing, absorbed
the new, contrasting atmosphere.

After the meal and after one or two respectful remarks - too short and simple to be called
speeches - had been made by those of the Elders apparently held most in esteem, an
informality forced itself upon the assembly.

It was as if the dignity of greeting foreign personages had finally given way to the amiable rustic
qualities of curiosity and friendliness.

They crowded around the two strangers and the flood of questions came.

They asked if it were difficult to handle a spaceship, how many men were required for the job, if
better motors could be made for their ground-cars, if it was true that it rarely snowed on other
worlds as was said to be the case with Tazenda, how many people lived on their world, if it was
as large as Tazenda, if it was far away, how their clothes were woven and what gave them the
metallic shimmer, why they did not wear furs, if they shaved every day, what sort of stone that
was in Pritcher's ring - The list stretched out.

And almost always the questions were addressed to Pritcher as though, as the elder, they
automatically invested him with the greater authority. Pritcher found himself forced to answer at
greater and greater length. It was like an immersion in a crowd of children. Their questions
were those of utter and disarming wonder. Their eagerness to know was completely irresistible
and would not be denied.

Pritcher explained that spaceships were not difficult to handle and that crews varied with the
size, from one to many, that the motors of their ground-cars were unknown in detail to him but
could doubtless be improved, that the climates of worlds varied almost infinitely, that many
hundreds of millions lived on his world but that it was far smaller and more insignificant than the
great empire of Tazenda, that their clothes were woven of silicone plastics in which metallic
luster was artificially produced by proper orientation of the surface molecules, and that they
could be artificially heated so that furs were unnecessary, that they shaved every day, that the
stone in his ring was an amethyst. The list stretched out. He found himself thawing to these



naive provincials against his will.

And always as he answered there was a rapid chatter among the Elders, as though they
debated the information gained. It was difficult to follow these inner discussions of theirs for
they lapsed into their own accented version of the universal Galactic language that, through
long separation from the currents of living speech, had become archaic.

Almost, one might say, their curt comments among themselves hovered on the edge of
understanding, but just managed to elude the clutching tendrils of comprehension.

Until finally Channis interrupted to say, "Good sirs, you must answer us for a while, for we are
strangers and would be very much interested to know all we can of Tazenda."

And what happened then was that a great silence fell and each of the hitherto voluble Elders
grew silent. Their hands, which had been moving in such rapid and delicate accompaniment to
their words as though to give them greater scope and varied shades of meaning, fell suddenly
limp. They stared furtively at one another, apparently quite willing each to let the other have all
the floor.

Pritcher interposed quickly, "My companion asks this in friendliness, for the fame of Tazenda
fills the Galaxy and we, of course, shall inform the governor of the loyalty and love of the Elders
of Rossem."

No sigh of relief was heard but faces brightened. An Elder stroked his beard with thumb and
forefinger, straightening its slight curl with a gentle pressure, and said: "We are faithful servants
of the Lords of Tazenda."

Pritcher's annoyance at Channis' bald question subsided. It was apparent, at least, that the age
that he had felt creeping over him of late had not yet deprived him of his own capacity for
making smooth the blunders of others.

He continued: "We do not know, in our far part of the universe, much of the past history of the
Lords of Tazenda. We presume they have ruled benevolently here for a long time."

The same Elder who spoke before, answered. In a soft, automatic way he had become
spokesman. He said: "Not the grandfather of the oldest can recall a time in which the Lords
were absent."

"It has been a time of peace?"

"It has been a time of peace!" He hesitated. "The governor is a strong and powerful Lord who
would not hesitate to punish traitors. None of us are traitors, of course."

"He has punished some in the past, I imagine, as they deserve."

Again hesitation, "None here have ever been traitors, or our fathers or our fathers' fathers. But
on other worlds, there have been such, and death followed for them quickly. It is not good to
think of for we are humble men who are poor farmers and not concerned with matters of
politics."

The anxiety in his voice, the universal concern in the eyes of all of them was obvious.



Pritcher said smoothly: "Could you inform us as to how we can arrange an audience with your
governor."

And instantly an element of sudden bewilderment entered the situation.

For after a long moment, the elder said: "Why, did you not know? The governor will be here
tomorrow. He has expected you. It has been a great honor for us. We ... we hope earnestly that
you will report to him satisfactorily as to our loyalty to him."

Pritcher's smile scarcely twitched. "Expected us?"

The Elder looked wonderingly from one to the other. "Why ... it is now a week since we have
been waiting for you."

Their quarters were undoubtedly luxurious for the world. Pritcher had lived in worse. Channis
showed nothing but indifference to externals.

But there was an element of tension between them of a different nature than hitherto. Pritcher,
felt the time approaching for a definite decision and yet there was still the desirability of
additional waiting. To see the governor first would be to increase the gamble to dangerous
dimensions and yet to win that gamble might multi-double the winnings. He felt a surge of
anger at the slight crease between Channis' eyebrows, the delicate uncertainty with which the
young man's lower lip presented itself to an upper tooth. He detested the useless play-acting
and yearned for an end to it.

He said: "We seem to be anticipated."

'Yes," said Channis, simply.

"Just that? You have no contribution of greater pith to make. We come here and find that the
governor expects us. Presumably we shall find from the governor that Tazenda itself expects
us. Of what value then is our entire mission?"

Channis looked up, without endeavoring to conceal the weary note in his voice: "To expect us
is one thing; to know who we are and what we came for, is another."

"Do you expect to conceal these things from men of the Second Foundation?"

"Perhaps. Why not? Are you ready to throw your hand in? Suppose our ship was detected in
space. Is it unusual for a realm to maintain frontier observation posts? Even if we were ordinary
strangers, we would be of interest."

"Sufficient interest for a governor to come to us rather than the reverse?'

Channis shrugged: "Weâ€™ll have to meet that problem later. Let us see what this governor is
like."

Pritcher bared his teeth in a bloodless kind of scowl. The situation was becoming ridiculous.

Channis proceeded with an artificial animation: "At least we know one thing. Tazenda is the
Second Foundation or a million shreds of evidence are unanimously pointing the wrong way.



How do you interpret the obvious terror in which these natives hold Tazenda? I see no signs of
political domination. Their groups of Elders apparently meet freely and without interference of
any sort. The taxation they speak of doesn't seem at all extensive to me or efficiently carried
through. The natives speak much of poverty but seem sturdy and well-fed. The houses are
uncouth and their villages rude, but are obviously adequate for the purpose.

"In fact, the world fascinates me. I have never seen a more forbidding one, yet I am convinced
there is no suffering among the population and that their uncomplicated lives manage to
contain a well-balanced happiness lacking in the sophisticated populations of the advanced
centers."

"Are you an admirer of peasant virtues, then?"

"The stars forbid." Channis seemed amused at the idea. "I merely point out the significance of
all this. Apparently, Tazenda is an efficient administrator - efficient in a sense far different from
the efficiency of the old Empire or of the First Foundation, or even of our own Union. All these
have brought mechanical efficiency to their subjects at the cost of more intangible values.
Tazenda brings happiness and sufficiency. Don't you see that the whole orientation of their
domination is different? It is not physical, but psychological."

"Really?" Pritcher, allowed himself irony. "And the terror with which the Elders spoke of the
punishment of treason by these kind hearted psychologist administrators? How does that suit
your thesis?"

"Were they the objects of the punishment? They speak of punishment only of others. It is as if
knowledge of punishment has been so well implanted in them that punishment itself need never
be used. The proper mental attitudes are so inserted into their minds that I am certain that not a
Tazendian soldier exists on the planet. Don't you see all this?"

"Iâ€™ll see perhaps," said Pritcher, coldly, "when I see the governor. And what, by the way, if our
mentalities are handled?"

Channis replied with brutal contempt: "You should be accustomed to that."

Pritcher whitened perceptibly, and, with an effort, turned away. They spoke to one another no
more that day.

It was in the silent windlessness of the frigid night, as he listened to the soft, sleeping motions
of the other, that Pritcher silently adjusted his wrist-transmitter to the ultrawave region for which
Channis' was unadjustable and, with noiseless touches of his fingernail, contacted the ship.

The answer came in little periods of noiseless vibration that barely lifted themselves above the
sensory threshold.
